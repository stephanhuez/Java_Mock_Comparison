Rough idea:
===========
=> Write an application that reads "batch transactions" from a file and executes them.
=> A file can be either plain text or XML or JSON
=> The transactions are executed either in memory or persisted into an XML file or in a database.

=> Transactions:
	=> Create product
	=> Update product
	=> Delete product

Method:
=======
=> Write the whole application TDD
=> Make use of Mock Frameworks to illustrate their usage
=> Write it in such a way that is is possible to easily substitute mock frameworks
=> Let the code be an example of clean code :-)

TO DO:
======
=> Refactor Test_TransactionFactory to use Given/When/Else syntax
=> Clean up the parsing of arguments to instantiate products
=> Write an FileDrop component that will wait for Transactions
=> Report errors during transaction processing in an output folder

DONE:
=====
=> Add validations to the transactions
=> Use Gradle for building the project
=> Use packages to organise the code
=> Parse the XML Element from XmlSourceReader
=> Refactor to a more canonical form of constructor parameters for Transactions
=> Read transactions from an XML file
=> Refactor the TransactionReader to be independent of the Input source and Parser
=> Read transactions from a text file
